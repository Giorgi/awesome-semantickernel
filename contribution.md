# Contribution Guidelines

The Awesome Semantic Kernel curates content and projects using or supporting Semantic kernel ecosystem. The contribution needs to be open source. The list is curated in a way that only the best content is listed. This means that not all content will be listed. The content that is listed should be of high quality and have a clear added value.

We do not list content that is:

- not related to semantic kernel.
- not maintained anymore.
- not online anymore.
- not open source.
- not adding value to existing content.

We do not aim to list all Semantic Kernel supported platforms already listed in the Semantic Kernel documention, but we may list articles and examples demonstrating their usage.

When adding a new item, please place it at the bottom of the list.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-\* list guidelines.
